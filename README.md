# awesome-discourse-communities

> A list of all Discourse communities on the World Wide Web.

## Motivation

When looking for an online community, I was often defaulting to searching for a fitting subreddit. But with Ethereum's heavy reliance on Discourse in recent years, I'm now asking myself: "Hey, is there a Discourse forum/community for X?". But when searching for usable lists online, all I find is links to paid data set providers. Additionally, I don't really know how to create such list myself: What would the technologies to do so look like? Building a page crawler like Google?

Hence, I think we should just co-create this list through crowd-sourcing contributions. So if you know your niche's best Discourse communities, please consider adding them as links here to help others gain an overview. I'll start by adding some links from the Ethereum/Crypto ecosystem.
